    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The term <strong>"Big 3"</strong> refers to three anime series that defined 
        an entire generation of fans during the 2000s. These shows were not only 
        long-running and commercially successful, but they also played a major role 
        in expanding anime's global popularity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Years later, a new wave of anime titles rose to international fame. 
        With improved animation quality and streaming platforms making access easier, 
        fans began referring to a modern trio as the <em>New Big 3</em>.

    <h2>The Rise of the New Big 3</h2>
    <p>
        In the late 2010s, anime entered a new era dominated by seasonal releases 
        and cinematic-quality animation. Streaming platforms allowed series to 
        reach audiences instantly worldwide.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong> - Dark fantasy and curse battles</li>
        <li><strong>Demon Slayer</strong> - Emotional storytelling with stunning visuals</li>
        <li><strong>My Hero Academia</strong> - Superhero-inspired shonen action</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        These series quickly gained massive popularity and are often considered 
        the spiritual successors to the original Big 3.
